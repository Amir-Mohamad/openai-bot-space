# OpenAI Bot Spaces in Django ðŸ¤–ðŸš€

This project provides a Django framework for managing OpenAI bot spaces, enabling users to interact with specific bots and send requests to the OpenAI API.

## Features

* **Bot Space Management:** Define and manage different bot spaces, each with its own set of configurations and functionalities.
* **User Interaction:** Allow users to interact with specific bots within their designated spaces.
* **OpenAI API Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with the OpenAI API to leverage its powerful language models and capabilities.
* **Request Handling:**  Process user requests, extract relevant information from bot spaces, and construct comprehensive requests to the OpenAI API.
* **Response Processing:**  Receive responses from the OpenAI API and present them to users in a clear and concise manner.
